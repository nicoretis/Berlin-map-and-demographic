# Berlin map and demographics
The repository contains three different projects and each images (.png) and videos (.mp4) files can be found under the following folder:

## Centroid of Berlin
The weighted centroid of the city is calculated by considering the geographic location of each individual within the city's districts. This means that the centroid is not simply the geographic center of the city's boundaries, but rather a point that takes into account the distribution of residents across different districts, with each resident's location contributing proportionally to their respective district's population density

## Age index
This project focuses on visualizing the aging index of neighborhoods in Berlin. The aging index is calculated as the ratio of the number of individuals aged over 65 to the number of individuals aged under 15 within each neighborhood. By representing this data as a heatmap, we gain insights into the demographic distribution and aging trends across different parts of Berlin.

## Migration trend
This repository contains a video heatmap illustrating migration trends in Berlin's districts from 2013 to 2023. The heatmap shows the influx and outflux of foreign nationals, German citizens, and the total population (foreign and German) over the specified timeframe. By visualizing these migration patterns, we gain insights into the changing demographics and migration dynamics within Berlin.
